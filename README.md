# Maxwell Creek Watershed Project Visualisations

This project hosts code, assets and visualisations for the
[Maxwell Creek Watershed Project](https://transitionsaltspring.com/maxwell-creek-watershed-project/) which is being
undertaken by [Transition Salt Spring](https://transitionsaltspring.com/).

The objective of the project is to develop a better understanding of the status and current condition of the forests
and local hydrology around the lake, notably, the potential for fire and the spread of fire, and to develop a strategy
to reduce these risks.

You can browse the working drafts of our visualisations in [GitHub pages](https://imerss.github.io/maxwell/).
